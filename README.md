# RainfallRunnoffModel
This code is currently under active development and provides machine learning models for Rainfall runoff modeling. Currently the machine learning algorithms XGBoost, LightGBM, SVR, MLP, LSTM, and GRU are implemented. Hyper parameter optimzation is done using a Bayesion optimization process. All input data are taken from the Camels_CH dataset (HÃ¶ge et al., 2023, https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10354485)
