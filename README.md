# RainfallRunnoffModel
This code is currently under active development and provides machine learning models for Rainfall runoff modeling. Currently the machine learning algorithms XGBoost, LightGBM, SVR, MLP, LSTM, and GRU are implemented. Hyper parameter optimzation is done using a Bayesion optimization process. The results of the catchments used for pretesting are available. Unfortunately I'm currently not allowed to provide a sample data set due to legal reasons until the Federal Office of Meteorology and Climatology (MeteoSwiss) provides data free of charge as open government data.
